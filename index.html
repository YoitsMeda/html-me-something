                <h2 id="Coding Experienece Header"> My Coding Experience</h2>
                <p id="mycodingexp">
                  When it comes to my coding experience I have started my journey with a lot of self study now.
                  With major help from the likes of <strong>LaunchCode</strong> they gave a lot of tools for success when it comes to just general knowledge.
                  So far I have been learning the ins and outs of Python,Java,HTML,CSS, and starting to self teach some JavaScript.
                  Coding has been one of the most wonerful things I could have ran after.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  It feels like something that I have been missing from my life for a long time.
                  I am always always open to learning more I really want to learn as much I can and to keep on learning because age may take my body little by litte but I'll always have my mind.
                  If you are looking for someone to teach and have as a wonderful new addition to your team I would love to join in this good fight!
                  I will have a contact infomation and hopefully an embeded emailer at the bottom. Don't worry I'll make it easy you can contact me at <strong>Yemedagrayson@gmail.com</strong>.

                <p id="aboutmychannel">
                  So if are you here for my Twitch channel or don't know about here is a good reason why to know about it.
                  Also here is a "why" I stream.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>Why I Stream</strong>
                  Well I like play video games <strong>DUH</strong> but I also like to think I'm pretty good at most or decent.
                  Also I love talking to people from time to time I don't mind connecting with strangers that normally won't connect with people.
                  Sometimes a person on the otherside of the screen can be helpful.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Do I want to become the next Ninja? Not really but for something in my past time I would at least like to have
                  given someone a nice word here or there that could help them. It's a wonderful thing to think about everytime I click on go live. So I would always love to see your name in my chat
                  or even if you want to just lurk just like I use to. You are more than welcome so stop by <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/somecrazywizbiz">click here and say hi!</a>Also if you're not following hit the follow button and I will love you forever
